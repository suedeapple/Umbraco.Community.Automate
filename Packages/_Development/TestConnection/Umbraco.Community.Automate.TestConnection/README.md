# Test Connection

> **For development only.** The Demo site uses this to test connections. It isn't meant to be installed in a real site, and it's never published.

One action, **Test Connection** (`community.testConnection`), that runs a connection's own **Test connection** check from an automation, the same check as the button under **Automation → Settings → Connections**.

| Setting | What it is |
|---|---|
| **Connection** | The alias of the connection to test, e.g. `pushover`. |

| Output | What it is |
|---|---|
| `connected` | `true` when the check passed (a warning still counts), `false` when it failed or there's no connection with that alias. |
| `message` | What the check reported, e.g. "Connected to httpbin.org." or why it failed. |

The step always succeeds, because a failed check is the answer you asked for. Branch on it with an **If** step: `${ steps.testConnection.connected }` equals `true`.

## In the Demo site

Each page under **Content → Automate tests** has a *Test: …* automation: publishing the page runs Test Connection for that page's connection, and an If step shows a green or red message saying whether it works. See [Running the Demo site](https://github.com/umbraco-community/Umbraco.Community.Automate/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#running-the-demo-site).

## Run the tests

```bash
dotnet test Packages/_Development/TestConnection/Umbraco.Community.Automate.TestConnection.Tests
