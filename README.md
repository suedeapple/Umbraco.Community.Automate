# Umbraco.Community.Automate

A home for community-built packages for [Umbraco Automate](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Automate), and a starter kit for building your own.

Umbraco Automate adds an **Automation** section to the Umbraco backoffice, where you build workflows from a *trigger* (for example "content published") and *actions* (for example "post to Mastodon"). Each package in this repo adds connection types, actions or triggers for one service. The repo gives you everything you need to add another one:

- **The `umbraco-automate` skill** for [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), which builds new packages and migrates existing ones to the repo's conventions.
- **[Packages](#packages)** to use as they are, or to learn from.
- **[Two examples](#examples)** to copy, one simple and one with everything.
- **[A Demo site](#running-the-demo-site)** with every package installed, to try them in a real backoffice.
- **CI and releases** that pick up a new package from its folder, with no workflow to edit.

## Building a package with the skill

**We recommend using the skill to create every new package and to migrate every existing one.** It builds them all the same way, so every package has the same structure, naming, configuration and tests, and anyone who knows one package can find their way around the rest.

### Install it

The skill lives in this repo at [`.claude/skills/umbraco-automate/`](.claude/skills/umbraco-automate/SKILL.md), so there's nothing to install apart from Claude Code itself. It's written for this repo's layout, so use it in a clone:

1. Install [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code).
2. [Fork this repo](https://github.com/umbraco-community/Umbraco.Community.Automate/fork) and clone your fork.
3. Start Claude Code in the repo's root folder (`claude` in a terminal, or open the folder in VS Code or JetBrains with the Claude Code extension).

Claude Code loads the skill whenever you ask for something Automate-related. You can also call it by name with `/umbraco-automate`.

### Create a package

Ask for the package you want, for example:

> Using the Umbraco Automate skill, create me a package for the PokéAPI, with an action that looks up a Pokémon by name.

The skill researches the service first. Then it walks you through the choices one at a time, recommending an option each time: which actions and triggers, how it connects, the names, and the settings for each action. When you confirm a summary, it builds the package with tests, wires it into the solution and the Demo site, and writes the package's README.

### Migrate a package

To bring in a package you already publish, ask it to:

> Using the Umbraco Automate skill, migrate my package from `<path or repo URL>`.

It reads your code and asks the questions that affect your existing users: whether to keep your package ID and aliases, and how configuration moves. Then it reshapes the package to match the others.

### Change an existing package

For smaller jobs, ask in the same way: "Using the Umbraco Automate skill, add a trigger to Mastodon". The skill follows the same conventions.

Not using Claude Code? [Adding a new package](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-a-new-package) in CONTRIBUTING has the same process as a checklist, and the [examples](#examples) are there to copy.

## Packages

Each package's README explains how to install and set it up, including its configuration, all its settings, and troubleshooting.

| Package | What it does | Status |
|---|---|---|
| [DevTo](Packages/DevTo/Umbraco.Community.Automate.DevTo/README.md) | Cross-posts Umbraco content to [DEV Community](https://dev.to). Converts Markdown, Rich Text, Block List and Block Grid to Markdown, and sets the canonical URL to your site. | [![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/Umbraco.Community.Automate.DevTo?color=0273B3)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Umbraco.Community.Automate.DevTo) pre-release |
| [GoogleSheets](Packages/GoogleSheets/Umbraco.Community.Automate.GoogleSheets/README.md) | Connects to Google Sheets with OAuth. Appends, finds, updates, deletes and upserts rows; reads and clears ranges; creates spreadsheets and tabs. | Not yet on NuGet |
| [Mastodon](Packages/Mastodon/Umbraco.Community.Automate.Mastodon/README.md) | Posts statuses to any Mastodon instance, with visibility, content warnings and an appended URL. Replaces `OC.Automate.Mastodon`. | Not yet on NuGet |
| [Pushover](Packages/Pushover/Umbraco.Community.Automate.Pushover/README.md) | Sends push notifications to phones and desktops through [Pushover](https://pushover.net/), with titles, links, sounds and priorities, including emergency alerts that repeat until acknowledged. Replaces `SA.Automate.Pushover`. | Not yet on NuGet |
| [Skoda](Packages/Skoda/Umbraco.Community.Automate.Skoda/README.md) | Reads a Škoda vehicle's status and controls charging, air conditioning, auxiliary heating and ventilation through the MyŠkoda Public API. | In development |
| [WeatherApi](Packages/WeatherApi/Umbraco.Community.Automate.WeatherApi/README.md) | Gets the current weather or today's forecast for a location from [WeatherAPI.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/). Replaces `SA.Automate.WeatherApi`. | Not yet on NuGet under this name |

### Examples

`Packages/_Examples/` holds two small, working packages to copy when you start a new one by hand, and that the skill builds from. Both talk to [httpbin.org](https://httpbin.org), so they work in the Demo site with no signup. CI builds and tests them, but they're never published.

- [**Simple**](Packages/_Examples/Simple/Umbraco.Community.Automate.Examples.Simple/README.md): an API key and one action, the shape most packages need.
- [**Kitchen Sink**](Packages/_Examples/KitchenSink/Umbraco.Community.Automate.Examples.KitchenSink/README.md): every convention in one place: a connection, two actions, a trigger, outcomes, an API client, a backoffice front end and tests.

## Running the Demo site

`Umbraco.Community.Automate.Demo/` is a throwaway Umbraco site that references every package and example. It installs itself into a local SQLite database the first time it runs, so there's no database server or setup screen. You'll need the [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download), [Node.js 22](https://nodejs.org/) and a trusted dev certificate (`dotnet dev-certs https --trust`).

```bash
# Backoffice front ends are generated, not committed: build them once
cd Packages/GoogleSheets/Umbraco.Community.Automate.GoogleSheets/Client
npm ci && npm run build
cd ../../../..
cd Packages/_Examples/KitchenSink/Umbraco.Community.Automate.Examples.KitchenSink/Client
npm ci && npm run build
cd ../../../../..

dotnet run --project Umbraco.Community.Automate.Demo
```

Or open `Umbraco.Community.Automate.Demo.slnx` in Visual Studio, Rider or VS Code and press F5.

Open <https://localhost:44343/umbraco> and log in as `admin@example.com` / `password1234`. The **Automation** section is in the top navigation: connections are under **Settings → Connections**, and automations under **Automations**.

Every package boots with placeholder credentials, so you can create connections and build automations straight away. The Simple and Kitchen Sink examples work end to end. To try a package against the real service, copy `Umbraco.Community.Automate.Demo/appsettings.Local.example.json` to `appsettings.Local.json` (git-ignored, so it can't be committed), fill in the values for that package, and restart the site. The package's README explains where to get them. [Running the Demo site](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#running-the-demo-site) in CONTRIBUTING covers user secrets, resetting the site and the end-to-end tests.
